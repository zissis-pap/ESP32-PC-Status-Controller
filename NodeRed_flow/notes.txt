Dear seller,
My local post office informed me that they won't be able to receive items from Asia due to the Covid-19 outbreak so my order will never reach me. Could you please inform me what happens with such orders? Are they returned to you or will they ship some time in the future?
Thank you in advance.

Best wishes.


Thank you for your kind understanding and I am really grateful we could work this out with the refund. 
Of course you will get a positive feedback and if I ever receive the item I am more than willing to pay you back the full amount since it is in my best interest to maintain a relationship of trust with your business.
Thank you again and have a nice day
